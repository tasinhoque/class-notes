### Cost Graphs

- Total cost vs quantity: (Short-run) Initially, there's a total cost even when there's no quantity. After that, cost increases as quantity increases. In the graph drawn in class, the curve grows slowly at first, but it picked up speed later.
- Average cost vs quantity: By average cost, we mean cost per quantity.

- Marginal cost vs quantity: The cost added by producing one additional unit of a product or service is called marginal cost. This cost is greater than average cost after crossing a certain quantity.

  At first, tangent to the graph of marginal cost vs quantity had a very steep slope. But this slope decreased as quantity increased. At some point, the slope becomes minimum. After that, the tangent gradually became steeper. So the graph of AC vs Q looks like an inverted parabola.

  MC = dC / dQ
