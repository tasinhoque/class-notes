**Question:** What is the relationship between average cost and average product? Also, what is the relationship between marginal cost and marginal product? Show graphically.

**Answer:**

We know,

AC = TC / Q ...(i)

AP = Q / N  
=> N / Q = 1 / AP ...(ii)

TVC = N x Pc ...(iii)

Here,  
AC = Average cost  
AP = Average product  
TC = Total cost  
Q = Total product/Quantity/Output  
N = Number of units of variable input  
TVC = Total variable cost  
Pc = Price per unit

In the long run,

AC = AVC  
 = TVC / Q  
 = N x Pc / Q [Using (iii)]  
 = Pc / AP [Using (ii)]

Here,  
AVC = Average variable cost

Now,

MC = d(TVC) /dQ  
 = d(N x Pc)/dQ [Using (iii)]  
 = Pc x dN / dQ  
 = Pc / (dQ / dN)  
 = Pc / MP [Using (ii)]

Here,  
MC = Marginal cost  
MP = Marginal product

Therefore we can conclude that cost and product are inversely proportional to each other.
