### Optimal consumption point

When the marginal utility is equal to the market price, the consumer will stop consuming. This point is the optimal point, since after this point, there wouldn't be any utility in buying the product anymore.

Price of ice-cream = px

Quantity of ice-cream = qx

Total expenditure, TE = px qx

Total utility, TU = f(qx)

Total consumer surplus (TCS) = TU - TE = TU - px qx

We need to maximize TU

Condition for maximization: 1st derivative = zero

del TU / del qx - del (px qx) / del qx = 0

=> del TU / del qx = px

=> MUx = px

That is, the optimal consumption point is the point when the marginal utility is equal to the market price.

The total utility curve is a downward-facing parabola.

The marginal utility can be negative (theoretically).

For the producer, the best thing would be to set high rate for smaller quantity and low rate for higher quantity.
