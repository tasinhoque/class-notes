Cobb-Douglas equation:

Y = A x K ^ (alpha) x L ^ (beta) ...(i)

Assuming perfect competition,  
alpha + beta = 1 ...(ii)

Isocost equation:

C = wL + rK ...(iii)

We assume,  
w = 5,  
r = 10,  
Y = 500,  
alpha = .3,  
A = 2

(ii) =>  
beta = .7

(i) =>  
500 = 2 x K ^ .3 x L ^ .7 ...(iv)

(iii) =>  
C = 5 x L + 10 x K

Differentiating,

dK/dL = -w/r = -0.5 ...(v)

By taking partial derivative of (i), we get  
d`Y` = del`Y` / del`K` x d`K` + del`Y` / del`L` x d`L`  
 = 0 (since quantity is constant in an isoquant graph)

=> dK/dL = -(del`Y`/ del`L`)/(del`Y` / del`K`) ...(vi)

From (iv),

del`Y` / del`L` = .7 x 2 x K ^ .3 x L ^ (-.3)

del`Y` / del`K` = .3 x 2 x K ^ (-.7) x L ^ .7

(vi) =>  
dK/dL = -(.7 x K) / (.3 x L)  
= -0.5 [From (v)]

=> K = 3L / 14 ...(vii)

(iv) & (vii) =>

500 = 2 x (3L / 14) ^ .3 x L ^ .7 = 2L x (3/14)^.3

=> L = 396.86

(viii) =>  
K = 85.04
