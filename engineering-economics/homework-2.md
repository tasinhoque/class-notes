Cobb-Douglas equation:

Y = A x K ^ (alpha) x L ^ (beta)

A = level of technology

Isocost equation:

C = wL + rK

We assume,  
w = 5,  
r = 10,  
Y = 500,  
alpha = .3,  
beta = .7,  
A = 2

500 = 2 x K ^ .3 x L ^ .7 ...(i)

C = 5 x L + 10 x K

dK/dL = -w/r = -0.5

del`Y` / del`L` = .7 x 2 x K ^ .3 x L ^ (-.3)

del`Y` / del`K` = .3 x A x K ^ (-.7) x L ^ .7

dK/dL = -(.7 x K) / (.3 x L) = -0.5

=> K = 3L / 14 ...(ii)

(i) & (ii) =>

500 = 2 x (3L / 14) ^ .3 x L ^ .7 = 2L x (3/14)^.3

=> L = 448.2

Hence, K = 96.04
