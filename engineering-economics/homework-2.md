Let us assume that the factors of production are capital (K) and labor (L), wage rate for labor is w and rental price of capital is k.

Then, in an isocost curve, the total cost is

C = rK + wL

=> K = (-w/r)L + C ...(i)

By differentiating (i) with respect to L, we get

dK/dL = -w/r

Therefore, if we draw a K vs L isocost graph, the slope would be (-w/r).

In an isoquant curve, the total quantity is

Q = f(K, L) = Y (suppose) ...(ii)

in other words, it's a function of K and L

By taking partial derivative of (ii), we get

d`Y` = del`Y` / del`K` x d`K` + del`Y` / del`L` x d`L`  
 = 0 (since quantity is constant in an isoquant graph)

=> dK/dL = -(del`Y`/ del`L`)/(del`Y` / del`K`)

But at the point of producer's equilibrium, the slope of the isocost curve and the slope of the isoquant curve are equal. Hence,

dK/dL = -w/r = -(del`Y`/ del`L`)/(del`Y` / del`K`)

=> (del`Y`/ del`L`) / w = (del`Y` / del`K`) / r

This last expression tells us that to minimize cost for a given level of output, a firm
should hire inputs up to the point where the last dollar spent on each input results in
the same increase in output. If this equality did not hold, a firm could lower its costs by
using more of one input and less of the other.
