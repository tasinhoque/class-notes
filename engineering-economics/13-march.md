## Iso-cost curve of capital and labor

![img](https://i.imgur.com/EI8dRRH.png)

Total cost (C) = Price of capital x K + Price of labor x L ...(i)

Price of capital = Interest = r

Price of labor = Wages = w

(i) =>

C = rK + wL

K = (-w/r)L + C

dK/dL = -w/r

### Iso-quant

Q = Y = F(K, L)

z = f(x, y)

dx/dy = ? (have to use PDE)

dY = del`Y`/ del`K` x dK + del`Y`/ del`L` x dL = 0

dK/dL = -(del`Y`/del`L`)/(del`Y`/del`K`)

Iso-quant can never intersect each other or touch the axes.

Iso-quant I3 gives us the most output, but it's beyond our capacity.

We can't go beyond AB.

J, L or M = same amount of cost

I2 > I1 and it's feasible

The equilibrium point is where the iso-cost touches the iso-quant

slope of iso-quant = slope of iso-cost

-(del`Y`/del`L`)/(del`Y`/del`K`) = -w/r

Y = A x K ^ (alpha) x L ^ (beta)

A = level of technology

C = wL + rK,  
w = 5,

Cobb-Douglas equation

Homework: Find out equilibrium point of K and L.

### Requisite Theory

Let us assume that the factors of production are capital (K) and labor (L), wage rate for labor is w and rental price of capital is k.

Then, in an isocost curve, the total cost is

C = rK + wL

=> K = (-w/r)L + C ...(i)

By differentiating (i) with respect to L, we get

dK/dL = -w/r

Therefore, if we draw a K vs L isocost graph, the slope would be (-w/r).

In an isoquant curve, the total quantity is

Q = f(K, L) = Y (suppose) ...(ii)

in other words, it's a function of K and L

By taking partial derivative of (ii), we get

d`Y` = del`Y` / del`K` x d`K` + del`Y` / del`L` x d`L`  
 = 0 (since quantity is constant in an isoquant graph)

=> dK/dL = -(del`Y`/ del`L`)/(del`Y` / del`K`)

But at the point of producer's equilibrium, the slope of the isocost curve and the slope of the isoquant curve are equal. Hence,

dK/dL = -w/r = -(del`Y`/ del`L`)/(del`Y` / del`K`)

=> (del`Y`/ del`L`) / w = (del`Y` / del`K`) / r

This last expression tells us that to minimize cost for a given level of output, a firm
should hire inputs up to the point where the last dollar spent on each input results in
the same increase in output. If this equality did not hold, a firm could lower its costs by
using more of one input and less of the other.
