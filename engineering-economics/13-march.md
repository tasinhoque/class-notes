K = Capital  
L = Labor

## Iso-cost curve of capital and labor

![img](https://i.imgur.com/EI8dRRH.png)

Total cost (C) = Price of capital x K + Price of labor x L ...(i)

Price of capital = Interest = r

Price of labor = Wages = w

(i) =>

C = rK + wL

K = (-w/r)L + C

dK/dL = -w/r

### Iso-quant

Q = Y = F(K, L)

z = f(x, y)

dx/dy = ? (have to use PDE)

dY = del`Y`/ del`K` x dK + del`Y`/ del`L` x dL = 0

dK/dL = -(del`Y`/del`L`)/(del`Y`/del`K`)

Iso-quant can never intersect each other or touch the axes.

Iso-quant I3 gives us the most output, but it's beyond our capacity.

We can't go beyond AB.

J, L or M = same amount of cost

I2 > I1 and it's feasible

The equilibrium point is where the iso-cost touches the iso-quant

slope of iso-quant = slope of iso-cost

-(del`Y`/del`L`)/(del`Y`/del`K`) = -w/r

Y = A x K ^ (alpha) x L ^ (beta)

A = level of technology

Given,  
C = wL + rK,  
w = 5,  
r = 10,

MP`L` =

MP`K` =

Cobb-Douglas equation

Homework: Find out equilibrium point of K and L.
