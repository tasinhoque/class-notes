Classification of Economics:

- Microeconomics: Economy of an individual unit (e.g. a firm). For
  example, how much revenue is this firm generating?

- Macroeconomics: Economy of the whole nation. For example, what is
  the GDP of this nation?

  - Aggregate demand: Taking all demands into account.
  - Aggregate supply: Taking all supplies into account.

Development is multi-dimensional. Apparently, increase in GDP can be
viewed as a sign of progress. But what if increase in GDP doesn't
come with reduction of inequality?

Poverty is relative. In USA, a family without a car is (seemingly)
poor. But that's not the case in our country.
