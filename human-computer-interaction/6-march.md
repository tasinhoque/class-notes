### Hearing

- Apparatus
  - Outer ear
  - Middle ear
  - Inner ear
- Sound
  - Pitch
  - Loudness
  - Timber

Cocktail party phenomenon (there's a threshold though)

### Touch

- Thermoreceptors
- Nociceptors
- Mechanoreceptors
- Heat and cold
- Pain
- Pleasure

Finger is more sensitive than many other body parts

Kinethesis: Awareness of body position

### Movement

Time taken to respond = Reaction time + movement time

Reaction time varies among auditory, visual and paid feedback

Increasing reaction time decreases accuracy in the unskilled operator but a skilled operator's accuracy is unaffected.

Fitt's law:
(This law describes the time taken to hit a screen target.)

Mt = a + b log2 (D / S + 1)

Mt = Movement time
S = Size of the target
D = Distance

### Memory

Selection of memory governed by level of arousal.

Visual, auditory and haptic memory.

Selective attention
After much rehearsal, the memory gets transferred to long term.

On average, humans can remember only 5 to 9 digits at a time. But when information is chunked, we can remember much more. Furthermore, if each chunk have a meaning, memorization will be facilitated.

### Long-term memory

- Episodic
- Semantic

We can subconsciously choose to forget something.

Recall (assisted by cue) and recognition (assisted by information)

Reasoning:

- Deduction: Deducing things from known information
- Induction: Generalizing
- Abduction: Reasoning from event to cause
  - Sam drives fast when drunk, so if I see him driving fast, I'll assume that he's drunk.

### Errors

Slip: Right intention but failed to do it right, happens due to inattention
Mistake: Wrong intention, happens due to misunderstanding

The biological response to physical stimuli is called affect.
Affect can influence how to respond to situations either positively or negatively.

Relaxed users will be more forgiving of shortcomings in design.

Aesthetically pleasing and rewarding interfaces will increase positive affect.

Individual differences exist, so we need to ask ourselves, will design decision exclude section of user population?
