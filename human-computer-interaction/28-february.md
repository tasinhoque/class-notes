Ergonomics: The study of people's efficiency in their working environment.

[Taken from [Ergonomics][ergonomics]]

Ergonomics is the process of designing or arranging workplaces, products and systems so that they fit the people who use them.

Most people have heard of ergonomics and think it is something to do with seating or with the design of car controls and instruments – and it is… but it is so much more. Ergonomics applies to the design of anything that involves people – workspaces, sports and leisure, health and safety.

Ergonomics (or ‘human factors’ as it is referred to in North America) is a branch of science that aims to learn about human abilities and limitations, and then apply this learning to improve people’s interaction with products, systems and environments.

Ergonomics aims to improve workspaces and environments to minimise risk of injury or harm. So as technologies change, so too does the need to ensure that the tools we access for work, rest and play are designed for our body’s requirements.

- Used-to: If someone is used to using a product, then that product makes her want to use it again.
- Usable: Easy to use.

Our goal is to design a system so that unintended mistakes of users are minimized.

HCI is multi-disciplinary. Cognitive science is related to this field. We need to know about human senses in order to design technologies to best suit the needs.

### Human I/O

- Visual
- Auditory
- Haptic: Relating to the sense of touch
- Movement

### Human Memory

- Sensory
- Short-term
- Long-term

### Human Information Processing and Application

- Reasoning
- Problem Solving
- Skill
- Error

Emotion influences human capabilities

### Two Stages of Vision

- Physical reception of stimulus
- Processing and interpretation of stimulus

Chapter 1 of the textbook contains these topics  
1.2: Input-output channels

Images are formed upside-down on the retina.

### Interpretation

- Size and depth
  - Visual angle
  - Visual acuity: Ability to perceive detail
- Brightness
  - Visual acuity increases with luminance as does (eye) flicker
- Color
  - Made up of heu, intensity and saturation
  - Blue acuity is lowest

Optical illusions occur due to overcompensation.

Ambiguity should be avoided as much as possible.

Reading involves saccade (quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction).
