## The Interaction

- Interaction models
- Ergonomics
- Interaction styles
- Context

Here, by interaction, we mean communication between user and system.

direct/indirect

domain/goal/task

## Donald Norman's model

- User establishes the goal
- Formulates intention
- Specifies actions
- Executes action
- Perceives system state
- Interprets
- Evaluates with respect to goal

This model is from the perspective of user.

Gulf of Execution: Difference in users formulation of actions and actions allowed by system

Gulf of Evaluation: Difference in user's expectation of changed system state and actual presentation of state

### How to reduce slips and mistake

Slip: Better interface design

Mistake: Better understanding of system

### Abowd and Beale framework

- User
- Input
- System
- Output

Each of these parts have its own unique language.

### Ergonomics

Physical aspects of interfaces, industrial interfaces

Examples:

- Arrangement of controls and displays
  - Grouping according to function
  - Grouping according to frequency
  - Grouping sequentially
- Surrounding environment
- Health issues
- Use of color

We deal with artificial environments in the office, but in the industry, there's a physical environment which can be manipulated by interacting with a physical interface (e.g. knobs).
