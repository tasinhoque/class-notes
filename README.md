# Class Notes

I'll be storing all of my class notes of level 4 here.

## Term 1

I'll be taking the following courses:

- _CSE 406:_ Computer Security Sessional

- _CSE 410:_ Computer Graphics Sessional
- _CSE 425:_ [Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://bdren.zoom.us/j/67578331133?pwd=L2M2c2lOeDVBZU9kYUd5RXdqRVBmUT09)

That is, five theory courses, one being non-departmental (but still
interesting enough) and three lab courses.

Here is my class routine:
