# Class Notes

Here, I'll be storing all of my class notes from level 4. 

I'll be taking the following courses in term 1:

- _CSE 405:_ Computer Security
- _CSE 406:_ Computer Security Sessional
- _CSE 408:_ Software Development Sessional
- _CSE 409:_ Computer Graphics
- _CSE 410:_ Computer Graphics Sessional
- _CSE 425:_ Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
- _CSE 453:_ High Performance Database System (HPDS)
- _HUM 475:_ Engineering Economics

That is, five theory courses, one being non-departmental (but still
interesting enough) and three lab courses.
