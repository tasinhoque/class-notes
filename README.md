# Class Notes

Here I'll be storing all of my class notes from level 4. I'll
be taking the following courses in term 1:

- _CSE 405:_ [Computer Security](https://bdren.zoom.us/j/64689450739?pwd=SzUwL0o5WEZMVWIyRXY4dzN2RXo2UT09)
- _CSE 406:_ Computer Security Sessional
- _CSE 408:_ Software Development Sessional
- _CSE 409:_ [Computer Graphics](https://bdren.zoom.us/j/62457340769?pwd=K3NKa1BHejBlZHBNUGdLNmF4WjlJZz09)
- _CSE 410:_ Computer Graphics Sessional
- _CSE 425:_ [Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://bdren.zoom.us/j/67578331133?pwd=L2M2c2lOeDVBZU9kYUd5RXdqRVBmUT09)
- _CSE 453:_ High Performance Database System (HPDS)
- _HUM 475:_ Engineering Economics

That is, five theory courses, one being non-departmental (but still
interesting enough) and three lab courses.

Here is my class routine:
